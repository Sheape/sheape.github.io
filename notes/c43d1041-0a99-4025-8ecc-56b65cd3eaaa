- it is the one that you actually see.
- the self that has _characteristics_ that you were *nurtured* or, in some cases, *born* to have.
- built on [[id:be1be06e-96b5-4079-81a0-dd0183a52c8f][Self Knowledge]] (/social interactions/).
- it is who we actually are. It is how we _think, feel, look and act_.
- it can be seen by others, but because we have no way of knowing how others view us, the actual self is our *self-image*.
