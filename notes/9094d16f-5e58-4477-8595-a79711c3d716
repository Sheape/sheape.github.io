* Definition
- Specialized cellular modifications are alterations in cells that distinguish
  them from one another.
- Cellular modifications are commonly found in [[id:be529198-40bb-45a3-b440-20ffb51d6f97][eukaryotic cells]], where there is
  a need for *cell specialization*.
* Microvilli

- Greek word /mikros/, "small"
- Latin term /villus/, "hair"
- folds of the cell membrane that extend outward from the surface of certain
  cells.
- specialized for *absorption*, such as the digestive tract or kidneys.
- increase the _surface area_ of the cell membrane, thus allowing for more
  materials to be absorbed into the cell at a quicker rate.

- found at the root tips
- increase the *surface area* of a _root_.
- absorb most of their water and nutrients.
