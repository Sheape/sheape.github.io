1. Draw both vectors with proper length and
    orientation originating from the same point.
2. Complete a parallelogram using the two
    vectors as two of the sides.
3. Draw the resultant vector as the diagonal
    originating from the tails.
4. Measure the length and angle of the
    resultant vector.
