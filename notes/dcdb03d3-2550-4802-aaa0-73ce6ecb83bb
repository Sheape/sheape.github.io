- A hairlike appendage that has a couple of functions for motility.
- The bacteria uses their flagella to:
  - move in fluid (/motility/),
  - in response to changes in concentration of chemical (/chemotaxis/)
  - movement in response to light (/phototaxis/) or movement in response to oxygen levels (/aerotaxis/)
  - helps in colonizing and infecting host organisms.
*** Types
1. Bacterial flagella
2. Archaeal flagella
