* Uniform Circular Motion
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       74458fa0-8f60-4c29-bb2d-f25fc943ef2d
:END:
- *Uniform circular motion* is motion along a circular path in which there is no
  change in speed, only a change in direction.
- Velocity _tangent_ to path.
- Force _toward_ center.
** Centripal Force
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       22a514b5-2bea-4b68-ab61-c0f19346c05f
:END:
- It is the force that keeps the object in circular motion.
** Centripal Acceleration

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
a_c & = \frac{v^2}{R}; \\
F_c & = ma_c = \frac{mv^2}{R}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
- where $m$ is mass of the object, $v$ is velocity, and $R$ is radius of the circular path.
- acceleration directed toward the center of circular path.
** Tangential Velocity
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3ca591c9-6965-4d36-b1ec-95cb2b7885ea
:END:
- when an object moves in a circular path at a distance $r$ from the center,
  then the body's velocity is directed /tangentially/ at any instant.
- the _linear velocity_ is its /tangential velocity/ at any instant.
** Tangential Acceleration
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       903c6e05-a9af-4669-a9a4-e5ac0210663b
:END:
- The *rate of change* of the tangential velocity of a particular in a circular
  orbit.
Formula (tho its not in the LAS):
$a_t = ar$
- $a_t$ is the /tangential acceleration/, $r$ is the radius of the circular path,
  and $a$ is the _angular acceleration_.
- always directs towards the /tangent/ to the path of the body.
