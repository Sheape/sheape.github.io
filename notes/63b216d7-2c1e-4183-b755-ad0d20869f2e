#+title: Free Fall
#+author: Paul Gerald D. Pare
#+date: August 17, 2023

* Definition
- *Air resistance* is neglected and the acceleration is _constant_ due to gravity.
- The acceleration of a freely falling body is called *acceleration due to gravity*.
  - Denote by letter $g$ which has a value of $-9.8 m/s^2$ or $32 ft/s^2$
    downward at the surface of the earth.
  - Every object experience this so this is also the _most common_ type of force.
- [[id:e2d2f809-64b0-402f-a045-b67ac2f9dc7c][Kinematics Equations]] can be used to analyze free fall.
- We may treat free fall as [[id:d0f008b3-2d59-40fb-b5a8-12b038177dc0][Uniformly Accelerated Motion]].
- Since motion is along vertical the vertical direction.
  - we may use $d_y$ instead of $d_x$ and $g$ instead of $a$.

- In a vacuum, all objects fall with _same acceleration_.
- Equations for constant acceleration apply as usual.
- Near the Earth's surface.

a. Distances _above_ the origin are *positive*. _Below_ the origin are *negative*.
b. _Upward_ velocities are *positive*, _downward_ velocities are *negative*.
c. $g$ is _always_ *negative*. origin is point of release.

* Time Symmetry
- The time required for the object to _reach maximum height_ equals the _time for_
  _it to return_ from its maximum height to its starting point.
* Speed Symmetry
- Shows that at any displacement above the point of release, the speed of the
  body during upward trip equals the speed during the downward trip.
