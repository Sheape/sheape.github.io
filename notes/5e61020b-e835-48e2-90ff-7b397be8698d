- used to describe a particular *phenomenon* by observing it.
- No _experimental manipulation_ and the research _does not start with a hypothesis_.
- /Anastas (1999)/ this research answers the questions (/What/, /Where/, /When/, /Who/, and /How/). +but not why+.
  - /Melegrito and Mendoza (2016, 23)/ These questions are linked to the *research questions*.
  - It does not answer "why" because we dont consider the explanation why certain things happen.
- the goal of this design is to only describe the person or the object of the study.
