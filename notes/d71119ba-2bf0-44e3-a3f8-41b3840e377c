+ *Technological convergence* is the synergy of technological advancements _to work on a similar goal or task_.
- The tendency for different technological systems to evolve toward performing similar tasks.
- _Telephones, consoles, DVD/CD players, cameras, and etc._ are being replaced with just a single phone since a phone can do everything as all of those without needing to buy them seperately.
- These old devices are then becoming *obsollete* in favor of personal computers or smartphones.
