* Kinetic Friction
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0866bbbf-daf5-4f92-beaf-3ae40e337016
:END:
- Once an object is in motion, kinetic friction opposes the ongoing motion
  between the two surfaces.
- $f_k = \mu_k\eta$
  + $f_k$ - kinetic friction
  + $\mu_k$ - coefficient of kinetic friction
  + $\eta$ - /symbol's name is eta/ is the normal force.
- always $f_k < f_s$
