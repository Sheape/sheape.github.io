- It is the sum of horizontal forces acting on the object.
- For horizontal equilibrium, the applied force and friction should balance each other out.
- $\sum\vec{F_x} = F_a - f$
  + $\sum\vec{F_x}$ represents the sum of horizontal forces.
  + $F_a$ is an applied force externally acting horizontally.
  + $f$ represents friction, which opposes motion.
  + If pulling force $F_a < friction\ f$ then furniture is at rest otherwise it
    will move to the right.
- $\sum\vec{F}_x = P_x - f$
  + $P_x$ is any horizontal force component applied to the object.
