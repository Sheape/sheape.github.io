:END:
1. The prefix is combined with the unit of measurement.
   - Ex: kilogram (kg), kilowatt (kW).
2. All of the prefix symbols are made from upper- and lower-case Latin except for _micro_.
3. SI units and unit symbols are never show in /italics/. The prefixes and symbols following that are always prefixed without any space or punctuation.
   - Ex: 'ms' means millisecond
   - 'm s' or 'm·s' means metre second
4. Prefixes up to power of 1000 are preferred rather than let's say tens (deci-, deca-) and hundreds (cent-, hecto-).
5. Prefixes cannot be used in combination on a single unit.
   - Ex: (mg) milligram instead of microkilogram (μkg).
6. The units are treated as multiplicative factors to values and the prefixes as 10x multiplier.
7. A prefix symbol attached to a unit symbol is included when the unit is raised to a power.
   - Ex: km^2 is km x km, not km x m
   - or you look at this as (km)^2 and not k(m)^2
