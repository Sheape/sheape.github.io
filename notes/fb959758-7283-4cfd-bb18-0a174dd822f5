:END:
- *Static friction* is the friction force when two surfaces in contact _do not move_
  against each other, in other words it is the _friction force at rest_.
- if the applied force $F_{a}$ exceeds the maximum static frictional force
  $f_s$, then the object will finally move in the direction of the applied force.
- [[id:3e726f82-bf1a-4cf0-a332-b28a53aa6589][Scalar]] only.
- $f_s = \mu_s\eta$
  + $f_s$ - maximum static friction force
  + $\mu_s$ - coefficient of static friction
  + $\eta$ - /symbol's name is eta/ magnitude of normal force.
- $\mu \propto f$
- $f_s \propto F_n$
