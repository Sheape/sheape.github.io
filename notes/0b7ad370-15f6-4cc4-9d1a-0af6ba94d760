- Also called _no membrane-bound organelles_.
- These are /organelles/ that are not inside of a membrane of a cell.

:END:
- It seperates what's inside and outside of the cell.
- They let some things through such as food and energy, but also defends itself from the environment and other cells.
- It is made of _phospholipid bilayer_ and the different types of proteins floating around it.
- The cell membrane is *semi-permeable*.
** Cell Wall
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c38e3073-0414-4c8b-bc9b-6ca38c5299cc
:END:
- Outer layer of [[id:79fc987e-0158-4755-a44f-426f769c5237][Plasma/Cell Membrane]].
- Made up of _peptidoglycan_, a polymer of sugars and amino acids that creates a mesh-like layer around the cell.
- Its function is to provide additional protection for the cell.
** Capsule
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       35745c84-d4fc-4ac1-8e63-a41c080bec24
:END:
- The outermost layer of the cell that provides the cover for the cell wall.
** Cytoplasm

- The interior of the cell is called the [[id:e3f8accc-0bd5-47c6-8268-b0fb72e873d4][Cytoplasm]].
- Specifically, the fluid within the membrane is called _cytosol_.
- Its a jelly-like fluid where all inside components are floating around.
** Nucleoid

- Similar to the nucleus in a eukaryotic cell, this holds genetic information about the cell.
- The [[id:4597c2d5-0e84-4ac5-ac3c-2d0b69f25e13][Ribosome]] is responsible for the DNA transcription to happen.
** Plasmid
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a98ea156-2bce-4285-8ebd-d974a87e7f47
:END:
- A small, _extrachromosomal DNA_ that is physicall seperated from the cell's DNA.
- It can replicate independently and is also vital for the survival of a cell or organism.
** Ribosome

#TODO: brb to this
- They are responsible for protein production as a product of DNA transcription.
- It does this by binding itself to _mRNA (messenger RNA)_ to determine the correct sequence of amino acids.
- The DNA translation provides the _protein_ (that includes enzymes from the DNA) and _DNA polymerase_.
- The process also provides _hexokinase_ which has a role in metabolism that provides the energy needed for the cell to function.
  - You can compare this to mitochondria in the eukaryotic cells.
** Flagellum
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       dcdb03d3-2550-4802-aaa0-73ce6ecb83bb
:END:
- A hairlike appendage that has a couple of functions for motility.
- The bacteria uses their flagella to:
  - move in fluid (/motility/),
  - in response to changes in concentration of chemical (/chemotaxis/)
  - movement in response to light (/phototaxis/) or movement in response to oxygen levels (/aerotaxis/)
  - helps in colonizing and infecting host organisms.
*** Types
1. Bacterial flagella
2. Archaeal flagella
