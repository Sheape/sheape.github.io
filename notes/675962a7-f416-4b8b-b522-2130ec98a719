- also called as the "_first change phase_".
- [[id:a3e8779a-2286-4862-ac3a-487fdf2a5bf8][Chromosomes]] become more _condensed_ and discrete.
- Each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a /kinetochore/.
- *Spindle microtubules* that do not engage the chromosomes are called /polar microtubules/.
  - They overlap each other midway between the two poles.
- *Astral microtubules*, aid in the spindle _orientation_.
