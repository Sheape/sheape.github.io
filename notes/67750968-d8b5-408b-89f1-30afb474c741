* Mitotic Phase
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       67750968-d8b5-408b-89f1-30afb474c741
:END:
- A phase in which the duplicated [[id:a3e8779a-2286-4862-ac3a-487fdf2a5bf8][chromosomes]] are aligned, seperated, and move
  into two new, identical _daughter cells_.
- The first portion of this phase is called [[id:e40abef7-815e-4fd7-b4b6-e2cd18214948][karyokinesis]] or _nuclear division_.
- The second portion of this phase is called [[id:f376509a-3232-4543-a85e-fe36bd1d3e58][cytokinesis]], which is the physical
  seperation of the two cytoplasmic components into two _daughter cells_.

- For mitotic phase, it is also called the _M (spindle) Checkpoint_
- it occurs during [[id:74371c98-f4da-4ce2-b020-96fc837b11cc][Metaphase]]
- attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochores are checked
  + This is to ensure that the chromatids are aligned properly.
