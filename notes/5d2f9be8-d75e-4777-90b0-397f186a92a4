* Kinds of Design
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5d2f9be8-d75e-4777-90b0-397f186a92a4
:END:
** Experimental Design
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f86e7aaa-9ec7-42c0-a9c6-8a6d6e3f2a84
:END:
- quantitative research design that bases its research method on an *experiment.
- in which a *test or examination* of a thing under a _manipulated or controlled environment_ is done to determine the validity of a thing.
- involves two groups of subjects:
  + _Experimental group_: in which the condition, treatment, or intervention is applied.
  + _Control group_: not given any treatment.
*** Quasi Experimental
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c2c8798b-98c3-4b77-9510-c1980761d31b
:END:
- also called /Causal comparative/.
- has *cause and effect relationship* of variables.
- _lesser validity_ due to the absence of random selection and assignment of subjects.
- /Gay (1996)/ considers this design as _descriptive_, for it describes existing conditions.
- more *structured manipulation* of _independent variables_.
- often used when [[id:ef6a169e-6c76-4a46-81da-ccdb2bbd2129][true experiments]] are not feasible due to ethical or practical constraints.
- the term /quasi/ means partly, partially, pseudo or almost.
#+begin_example
"The effects of unemployment on attitude towards following safety protocol in ECQ declared areas."
#+end_example

*** True Experimental
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ef6a169e-6c76-4a46-81da-ccdb2bbd2129
:END:
- a more robust design and has _more conclusive result_ than [[id:c2c8798b-98c3-4b77-9510-c1980761d31b][Quasi Experimental]].
- the researcher is authorized to control the situation and manipulates the _independent variable_ to detect its influence on the _dependent variable_.
- /Bryman (2008)/ In social science, many IVs cannot be manipulated.
- it uses random assignment of subjects and experimental manipulation.
#+begin_example
"A comparison of the effects of various blended learning to the reading comprehension of elementary pupils."
#+end_example

** Non-experimental Design
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0bb3b196-fe3f-421d-b50f-60fd5fcdd133
:END:
- quantitative research design that is capable of *giving both of qualitative and quantitative data* but more qualitative data.
- often used in _social sciences_.
- it does not have the capability to control variables.
- instead, it involves variables the way they naturally exist on Earth.
*** Descriptive
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5e61020b-e835-48e2-90ff-7b397be8698d
:END:
- used to describe a particular *phenomenon* by observing it.
- No _experimental manipulation_ and the research _does not start with a hypothesis_.
- /Anastas (1999)/ this research answers the questions (/What/, /Where/, /When/, /Who/, and /How/). +but not why+.
  - /Melegrito and Mendoza (2016, 23)/ These questions are linked to the *research questions*.
  - It does not answer "why" because we dont consider the explanation why certain things happen.
- the goal of this design is to only describe the person or the object of the study.
#+begin_example
Ex: "The determination of the different kinds of physical activities and how often high school students do it during the quarantine period."
#+end_example

*** Comparative
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e6bd7bfb-f223-4255-b5a0-17e9022bd902
:END:
- states the difference or similarities between or among people, things, objects, etc.
*** Correlational
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4fe9aad4-e091-46ac-91b2-d6ab32eefdeb
:END:
- identifies the relationship between *variables*.
- data is collected by *observation*.
- it does not consider the cause and effect.
- it is based on _pairs of measures_ or _scores_ of a single sample.
- /Melegrito and Mendoza (2016, 24-25)/ indicates the strengths of a relationship between two variables.
- No experimental manipulation.
#+begin_example
"The relationship of teenagers' sense of humor with positive psychological capacity."
#+end_example

*** Ex Post Facto
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c33fbf2f-372e-4da0-8b57-7d76032130e3
:END:
- investigate a possible relationship between *previous events* and _present conditions_.
- The term "/Ex Post Facto/", means _after the fact_.
- it looks at the *possible causes* of an already occuring phenomenon.
- No experimental manipulation.
#+begin_example
"How does the parent's academic achievement affect the children obesity?"
#+end_example

*** Survey
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5b5c1ec2-e45a-436b-9aa2-e44c911094a2
:END:
- /Bryman (2016)/
- intended to _acquire information_ from people.
- aims to gather data concerning the predominance, distribution, and interrelations of the variables within a group.
- aims to gather evidence of people's knowledge, opinions, attitudes, and values.
