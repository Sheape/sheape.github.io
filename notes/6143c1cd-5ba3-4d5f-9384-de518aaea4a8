+ HTML files and current web browsers could not support [[id:7c182520-cef4-4197-b1b0-0d703caeb0ca][Web 3.0]].
- Currently, modern web browsers have good compatibility with the [[id:7c182520-cef4-4197-b1b0-0d703caeb0ca][Semantic Web]], which includes:
#+begin_example
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

** Security

+ The user's security is also in question since the machine is saving his or her preferences.
- An advanced implementation of the semantic web would make it much easier for governments to control the _viewing and creation_ of online information.
#TODO: study about FOAF.
- With the use of _Friend of a friend_ (FOAF) Files and _geolocation meta-data_. There would be *little anonymity* associated with the authorship of articles such as _personal blog_.

+ The [[id:c98fb78e-23fd-4870-8d2c-29dfac416b1a][World Wide Web (WWW)]] already contains billions of web pages.
- The /SNOMED CT medical terminology ontology/ alone contains *370,000* class names.
- Any automated system to categorize these will have to deal with _huge inputs_.

** Vaugeness

:END:
+ Certain words are imprecise. The words "/old/" and "/small/" would depend on the user.
- A psychology study tells us that when we have a lot of choices, we are more likely to be indecisive and this is /choice paralysis/.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic][Fuzzy logic]] is the *most common technique* for dealing with vagueness.

** Logic

:END:
+ Since machines use logic, there are certain *limitations* for a computer to be able to predict what the user is referring to at a given time.
- However, recently AI is being used together with these websites to predict the user's next input based on billions of data in the AI.
