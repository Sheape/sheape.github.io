:END:
- The *rate of change* of the tangential velocity of a particular in a circular
  orbit.
Formula (tho its not in the LAS):
$a_t = ar$
- $a_t$ is the /tangential acceleration/, $r$ is the radius of the circular path,
  and $a$ is the _angular acceleration_.
- always directs towards the /tangent/ to the path of the body.
