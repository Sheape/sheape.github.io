- It is the sum of vertical forces acting on the object.
- In static equilibrium, the sum of vertical forces is zero, meaning the normal
  force and weight balance each other.
- $\sum\vec{F_y} = F_n - w = 0$ /(for static equilibrium)/
  + $\sum\vec{F}_y$ represents the sum of vertical forces.
  + $F_n$ is the normal force exerted by a supporting surface.
  + $w$ is the weight of the object due to gravity.
- $\sum\vec{F}_y = N + P_y - w = 0$
  + More detailed version of the first formula.
  + $\sum\vec{F}_y$ represents the sum of vertical forces.
  + $N$ is the normal force exerted by a supporting surface.
  + $P_y$ is any vertical force component applied to the object.
  + $w$ is the weight of the object due to gravity.
