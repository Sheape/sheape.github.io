* Research
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c9704694-db6f-4174-987a-0fd4c699b09e
:END:
- attemps to *seek answers* to questions.
- draw *conclusions* from data.
- generalizes conclusions.
- contribute to existing body of knowledge on a particular field.
- improves our understanding of the world.
** Processes
1. Identification of the problem
2. Definition of the problem
3. Documentation of _related literatures_ and studies
4. Development of a technique to gather data.
5. Collection of data
6. Analysis of data
7. Interpretation of data
8. Draw conclusion
9. Documentation of sources
10. Defense of the Topic

* Definition
- form of study that provides explanation about a certain event/occurrence by _gathering_ and _examining_ facts through the use of *mathematical tools*.
- to show relationships between *quantities* or *magnitudes* shown by numbers of symbols.
- involves _measurements_ and _quantities_.
- it is expressed _numerically_.
- *Numerical* indicates the exact expression of information through the use of _figures_ and _quantities_
- using this type of data in research denotes _specificity_, _particularity_, or exactness.
* Characteristics

:END:
- /Objectiveness/
- /Scientific/
** Large Sample Size
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d7b21050-34bf-4e22-93dd-9f68331e6c5b
:END:
- to obtain a more [[id:0c594575-bf60-4def-bfef-d3f117647b13][accurate]] result, the data must come from a large sample size.
** Objective
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5efe5835-ba9d-4ba2-b3e3-2d8371804c17
:END:
#+begin_quote
"Numbers don't lie"
#+end_quote
+ Data gathering and analysis of data are done [[id:0c594575-bf60-4def-bfef-d3f117647b13][accurately]], _objectively_, and unaffected by the researcher's intuition, emotion, and guesses.
** Visual Result
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a43c7c3f-450f-491c-951a-0b0749c6aa0d
:END:
- Data is _numerical_, which makes presentation through graphs charts, and tables possible and for better conveyance and interpretation.
** Faster Data Analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9de8a5b2-2464-42fe-8840-56034b65c751
:END:
- Unlike qualitative research, dealing with _numbers_ are much faster and easier.
- The use of a *statistical tools* give way for a less time-consuming data analysis.
** Generalized Data
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       19bb5426-0b90-4582-8653-9b2bbb8752db
:END:
#TODO: go back here to link sampling later.
- Data taken from a sample can be applied to the population if _sampling_ is done accordingly.
** Fast Data Collection
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       45b26bf2-100b-4ced-93cb-c9a0cfcb6ef7
:END:
- [[id:415ece4a-e910-48a4-8d1e-a4f284630c2e][Quantitative Research]] uses standardized research instruments that allow the researcher to collect data from a [[id:d7b21050-34bf-4e22-93dd-9f68331e6c5b][large sample size]] efficiently.
** Reliable Data
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       31fb5f10-bd8b-446b-b2e4-6a005a4361bc
:END:
- Data is taken and analyzed objectively from a sample as a representative of the population.
** Replication
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       45073606-11f6-4834-9e22-77e221ab2a39
:END:
- Quantitative method can be repeated to *verify* findings enhancing its _validity_.

* Kinds of Design
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5d2f9be8-d75e-4777-90b0-397f186a92a4
:END:
** Experimental Design
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f86e7aaa-9ec7-42c0-a9c6-8a6d6e3f2a84
:END:
- quantitative research design that bases its research method on an *experiment.
- in which a *test or examination* of a thing under a _manipulated or controlled environment_ is done to determine the validity of a thing.
- involves two groups of subjects:
  + _Experimental group_: in which the condition, treatment, or intervention is applied.
  + _Control group_: not given any treatment.
*** Quasi Experimental
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c2c8798b-98c3-4b77-9510-c1980761d31b
:END:
- also called /Causal comparative/.
- has *cause and effect relationship* of variables.
- _lesser validity_ due to the absence of random selection and assignment of subjects.
- /Gay (1996)/ considers this design as _descriptive_, for it describes existing conditions.
- more *structured manipulation* of _independent variables_.
- often used when [[id:ef6a169e-6c76-4a46-81da-ccdb2bbd2129][true experiments]] are not feasible due to ethical or practical constraints.
- the term /quasi/ means partly, partially, pseudo or almost.
#+begin_example
"The effects of unemployment on attitude towards following safety protocol in ECQ declared areas."
#+end_example

*** True Experimental
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ef6a169e-6c76-4a46-81da-ccdb2bbd2129
:END:
- a more robust design and has _more conclusive result_ than [[id:c2c8798b-98c3-4b77-9510-c1980761d31b][Quasi Experimental]].
- the researcher is authorized to control the situation and manipulates the _independent variable_ to detect its influence on the _dependent variable_.
- /Bryman (2008)/ In social science, many IVs cannot be manipulated.
- it uses random assignment of subjects and experimental manipulation.
#+begin_example
"A comparison of the effects of various blended learning to the reading comprehension of elementary pupils."
#+end_example

** Non-experimental Design
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0bb3b196-fe3f-421d-b50f-60fd5fcdd133
:END:
- quantitative research design that is capable of *giving both of qualitative and quantitative data* but more qualitative data.
- often used in _social sciences_.
- it does not have the capability to control variables.
- instead, it involves variables the way they naturally exist on Earth.
*** Descriptive
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5e61020b-e835-48e2-90ff-7b397be8698d
:END:
- used to describe a particular *phenomenon* by observing it.
- No _experimental manipulation_ and the research _does not start with a hypothesis_.
- /Anastas (1999)/ this research answers the questions (/What/, /Where/, /When/, /Who/, and /How/). +but not why+.
  - /Melegrito and Mendoza (2016, 23)/ These questions are linked to the *research questions*.
  - It does not answer "why" because we dont consider the explanation why certain things happen.
- the goal of this design is to only describe the person or the object of the study.
#+begin_example
Ex: "The determination of the different kinds of physical activities and how often high school students do it during the quarantine period."
#+end_example

*** Comparative
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e6bd7bfb-f223-4255-b5a0-17e9022bd902
:END:
- states the difference or similarities between or among people, things, objects, etc.
*** Correlational
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4fe9aad4-e091-46ac-91b2-d6ab32eefdeb
:END:
- identifies the relationship between *variables*.
- data is collected by *observation*.
- it does not consider the cause and effect.
- it is based on _pairs of measures_ or _scores_ of a single sample.
- /Melegrito and Mendoza (2016, 24-25)/ indicates the strengths of a relationship between two variables.
- No experimental manipulation.
#+begin_example
"The relationship of teenagers' sense of humor with positive psychological capacity."
#+end_example

*** Ex Post Facto
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c33fbf2f-372e-4da0-8b57-7d76032130e3
:END:
- investigate a possible relationship between *previous events* and _present conditions_.
- The term "/Ex Post Facto/", means _after the fact_.
- it looks at the *possible causes* of an already occuring phenomenon.
- No experimental manipulation.
#+begin_example
"How does the parent's academic achievement affect the children obesity?"
#+end_example

*** Survey
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5b5c1ec2-e45a-436b-9aa2-e44c911094a2
:END:
- /Bryman (2016)/
- intended to _acquire information_ from people.
- aims to gather data concerning the predominance, distribution, and interrelations of the variables within a group.
- aims to gather evidence of people's knowledge, opinions, attitudes, and values.
