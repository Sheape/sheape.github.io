- use it when you are given *2 sides and one angle* in a triangle. Obviously,
  these triangles in this case is about vectors.
- Note: The range of $cos^{-1}(x)\ |\ R = \{ 0, \pi \}$ so this is highly
  recommended to use instead of sine law.
Formulas:
\begin{align*}
a^2 & = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\ cosA \\
b^2 & = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac\ cosB \\
c^2 & = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\ cosC
\end{align*}
