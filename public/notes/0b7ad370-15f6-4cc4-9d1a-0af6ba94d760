- It seperates what's inside and outside of the cell.
- They let some things through such as food and energy, but also defends itself from the environment and other cells.
- It is made of _phospholipid bilayer_ and the different types of proteins floating around it.
- The cell membrane is *semi-permeable*.
*** Phospholipids
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4f0c1142-f8f3-4acf-acdd-73370a4d522e

- class of lipids that are major component of all cell membranes.
** Cell Wall
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Outer layer of [[id:79fc987e-0158-4755-a44f-426f769c5237][Plasma/Cell Membrane]].
- Made up of _peptidoglycan_, a polymer of sugars and amino acids that creates a mesh-like layer around the cell.
- Its function is to provide additional protection for the cell.
*** Plants
- It is in the cellulous.
*** Fungi
- contain _chitin_.
** Capsule
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       35745c84-d4fc-4ac1-8e63-a41c080bec24

- The outermost layer of the cell that provides the cover for the cell wall.
** Cytoplasm
:PROPERTIES:

- The interior of the cell is called the [[id:e3f8accc-0bd5-47c6-8268-b0fb72e873d4][Cytoplasm]].
- Specifically, the fluid within the membrane is called _cytosol_.
- Its a jelly-like fluid where all inside components are floating around.
*** Components
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       466bebab-56b2-4b08-8b83-31c6ae2a4787
:END:
- _Cytosol_
- Interconnected filaments & fibers.
- storage substances.
** Nucleoid

:END:
- Similar to the nucleus in a eukaryotic cell, this holds genetic information about the cell.
- The [[id:4597c2d5-0e84-4ac5-ac3c-2d0b69f25e13][Ribosome]] is responsible for the DNA transcription to happen.
** Plasmid
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a98ea156-2bce-4285-8ebd-d974a87e7f47
:END:
- A small, _extrachromosomal DNA_ that is physicall seperated from the cell's DNA.
- It can replicate independently and is also vital for the survival of a cell or organism.
** Ribosomes

- Sites of *protein synthesis*.
- They are responsible for protein production as a product of DNA transcription.
- It does this by binding itself to _mRNA (messenger RNA)_ to determine the correct sequence of amino acids.
- The DNA translation provides the _protein_ (that includes enzymes from the DNA) and _DNA polymerase_.
- The process also provides _hexokinase_ which has a role in metabolism that provides the energy needed for the cell to function.
  - You can compare this to mitochondria in the eukaryotic cells.

[[file:../w2/flagella.png]]
- Plural-form /Flagella/.
- Whip-like extensions that allows a cell to move.
- Found on *sperm* cells.
  + plenty of [[id:d5972910-a234-4998-9327-9a1a0ecaa566][mitochondria]].
- A hairlike appendage that has a couple of functions for motility.
- The bacteria uses their flagella to:
  - move in fluid (/motility/),
  - in response to changes in concentration of chemical (/chemotaxis/)
  - movement in response to light (/phototaxis/) or movement in response to oxygen levels (/aerotaxis/)
  - helps in colonizing and infecting host organisms.
*** Types
1. Bacterial flagella
2. Archaeal flagella

- Latin word for "eyelashes".
- _tiny hairs_ on the surface of certain cells.
- move in a rhythmic, sweeping motion and serve to move particles or cells in
  your body.
- cilia lining in respiratory tract.
- *Tracheal* cells
- Beat and drive air impurities or foreign particles and mucus up the trachea to
  the mouth
- Short
- Used to move substances outside human cells.
