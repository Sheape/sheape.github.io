- Vector Resolution. A single vector is usually divided into _two vectors_ that
  are perpendicular to each other. These two vectors are called *components* and
  the process of splitting the vector into its components is called resolution.
- V is represented as $V_x$ and $V_y$ respectively.
  - $V_x = V cos\theta$
  - $V_y = V sin\theta$
  - where \theta is the angle that V makes with the *x-axis*.
*** Component Method

- It is generally used when more than two vectors are to be
  added.
**** Steps
1. Resolve the given vectors into its horizontal and vertical components.
|----------+---+---|
| Quadrant | x | y |
|----------+---+---|
|        1 | + | + |
|        2 | - | + |
|        3 | - | - |
|        4 | + | - |
|----------+---+---|
2. Get the sum of the x-components and y-components which are also the x and y
   components for the _resultant_.
3. Use the *Pythagorean theorem* to find the magnitude of the resultant vector.
   $R^2=R_x^2 + R_y^2$
4. Use the signs of $R_x$ and $R_y$ to determine the quadrant.
5. Find the *reference angle* by taking the _inverse tangent_ of the absolute value
   of the *y-component* divided by the *x-component*.
   \begin{equation*}
   \theta = tan^{-1}|\frac{R_y}{R_x}|
   \end{equation*}
