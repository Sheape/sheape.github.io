- The magnitude of the resultant vector is given by the _arithmetic sum_ of the
  magnitudes of the individual vectors. The direction follows that of the given
  vectors.
*** Given
$\vec{A} = 20\ m/s,\ East$
$\vec{B} = 40\ m/s,\ East$
[[file:analytical_method_sum.png]]
$20\ m/s,\ East + 40\ m/s,\ East \rightarrow \vec{R} = 60\ m/s East$
