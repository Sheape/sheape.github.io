- Sites of *protein synthesis*.
- They are responsible for protein production as a product of DNA transcription.
- It does this by binding itself to _mRNA (messenger RNA)_ to determine the correct sequence of amino acids.
- The DNA translation provides the _protein_ (that includes enzymes from the DNA) and _DNA polymerase_.
- The process also provides _hexokinase_ which has a role in metabolism that provides the energy needed for the cell to function.
  - You can compare this to mitochondria in the eukaryotic cells.
