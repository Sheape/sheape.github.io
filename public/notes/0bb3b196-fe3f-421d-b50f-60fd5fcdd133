** Non-experimental Design
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0bb3b196-fe3f-421d-b50f-60fd5fcdd133
:END:
- quantitative research design that is capable of *giving both of qualitative and quantitative data* but more qualitative data.
- often used in _social sciences_.
- it does not have the capability to control variables.
- instead, it involves variables the way they naturally exist on Earth.
*** Descriptive
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5e61020b-e835-48e2-90ff-7b397be8698d
:END:
- used to describe a particular *phenomenon* by observing it.
- No _experimental manipulation_ and the research _does not start with a hypothesis_.
- /Anastas (1999)/ this research answers the questions (/What/, /Where/, /When/, /Who/, and /How/). +but not why+.
  - /Melegrito and Mendoza (2016, 23)/ These questions are linked to the *research questions*.
  - It does not answer "why" because we dont consider the explanation why certain things happen.
- the goal of this design is to only describe the person or the object of the study.
#+begin_example
Ex: "The determination of the different kinds of physical activities and how often high school students do it during the quarantine period."

*** Comparative
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e6bd7bfb-f223-4255-b5a0-17e9022bd902
:END:
- states the difference or similarities between or among people, things, objects, etc.
*** Correlational
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4fe9aad4-e091-46ac-91b2-d6ab32eefdeb
:END:
- identifies the relationship between *variables*.
- data is collected by *observation*.
- it does not consider the cause and effect.
- it is based on _pairs of measures_ or _scores_ of a single sample.
- /Melegrito and Mendoza (2016, 24-25)/ indicates the strengths of a relationship between two variables.
- No experimental manipulation.
#+begin_example
"The relationship of teenagers' sense of humor with positive psychological capacity."

*** Ex Post Facto
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c33fbf2f-372e-4da0-8b57-7d76032130e3
:END:
- investigate a possible relationship between *previous events* and _present conditions_.
- The term "/Ex Post Facto/", means _after the fact_.
- it looks at the *possible causes* of an already occuring phenomenon.
- No experimental manipulation.
#+begin_example
"How does the parent's academic achievement affect the children obesity?"
#+end_example

*** Survey
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5b5c1ec2-e45a-436b-9aa2-e44c911094a2
:END:
- /Bryman (2016)/
- intended to _acquire information_ from people.
- aims to gather data concerning the predominance, distribution, and interrelations of the variables within a group.
- aims to gather evidence of people's knowledge, opinions, attitudes, and values.
