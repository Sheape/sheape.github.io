- pictures that show the size and direction of all forces acting on an object.
* Steps to draw
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       074c20f7-3e19-44bd-a35f-eb6a62f81da2
:END:
1. Pick one object to analyze
2. Draw a box/point to represent the object
3. Draw an arrow to represent each force acting on the object.
4. Make sure the arrow shows the direction and relative size of the force.

- a type of _force_.
- also known as _air drag_ or _aerodynamic drag_, is a force that opposes the motion
  of an object through the air.
- think of it as friction but against *gravity* except it also works horizontally
  but its only for complex problems.
Formula:
$F_{air} = -kv^2$
- $k$ is a /constant/ that depends on the object's shape and other factors.
- $v$ is the object's velocity.
* Vertical Equilibrium

- It is the sum of vertical forces acting on the object.
- In static equilibrium, the sum of vertical forces is zero, meaning the normal
  force and weight balance each other.
- $\sum\vec{F_y} = F_n - w = 0$ /(for static equilibrium)/
  + $\sum\vec{F}_y$ represents the sum of vertical forces.
  + $F_n$ is the normal force exerted by a supporting surface.
  + $w$ is the weight of the object due to gravity.
- $\sum\vec{F}_y = N + P_y - w = 0$
  + More detailed version of the first formula.
  + $\sum\vec{F}_y$ represents the sum of vertical forces.
  + $N$ is the normal force exerted by a supporting surface.
  + $P_y$ is any vertical force component applied to the object.
  + $w$ is the weight of the object due to gravity.
* Horizontal Equilibrium
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- It is the sum of horizontal forces acting on the object.
- For horizontal equilibrium, the applied force and friction should balance each other out.
- $\sum\vec{F_x} = F_a - f$
  + $\sum\vec{F_x}$ represents the sum of horizontal forces.
  + $F_a$ is an applied force externally acting horizontally.
  + $f$ represents friction, which opposes motion.
  + If pulling force $F_a < friction\ f$ then furniture is at rest otherwise it
    will move to the right.
- $\sum\vec{F}_x = P_x - f$
  + $P_x$ is any horizontal force component applied to the object.
* Net External Force
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7ba2cfe7-1942-4d36-9de1-989ef104cc6b
:END:
- The net external force acting on the object.
- The net external force determines the object's acceleration or state of rest.
  If it's zero, the object is in equilibrium.
- $\sum\vec{F} = F_{ax} - f$ /where $\vec{F}$ is the net external force/
  + $\sum\vec{F}$ represents the net external force.
  + $F_{ax}$ is the net applied force in the horizontal direction.
  + $f$ represents friction.
- $\sum\vec{F} = P_x - f$
  + $P_{x}$ is the net applied force in the horizontal direction.
  + If $\sum\vec{F}_y \neq 0$ then the object didn't touch the ground
    surface. Therefore, the net external force is $\neq \sum\vec{F}_x$
* Static Friction
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       fb959758-7283-4cfd-bb18-0a174dd822f5
:END:
- *Static friction* is the friction force when two surfaces in contact _do not move_
  against each other, in other words it is the _friction force at rest_.
- if the applied force $F_{a}$ exceeds the maximum static frictional force
  $f_s$, then the object will finally move in the direction of the applied force.
- [[id:3e726f82-bf1a-4cf0-a332-b28a53aa6589][Scalar]] only.
- $f_s = \mu_s\eta$
  + $f_s$ - maximum static friction force
  + $\mu_s$ - coefficient of static friction
  + $\eta$ - /symbol's name is eta/ magnitude of normal force.
- $\mu \propto f$
- $f_s \propto F_n$
* Kinetic Friction
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0866bbbf-daf5-4f92-beaf-3ae40e337016
:END:
- Once an object is in motion, kinetic friction opposes the ongoing motion
  between the two surfaces.
- $f_k = \mu_k\eta$
  + $f_k$ - kinetic friction
  + $\mu_k$ - coefficient of kinetic friction
  + $\eta$ - /symbol's name is eta/ is the normal force.
- always $f_k < f_s$
