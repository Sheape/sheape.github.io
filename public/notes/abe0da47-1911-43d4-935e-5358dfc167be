:END:
- many scientists theorize that eukaryotes evolved from prokaryote ancestors.
- in _1981_, *Lynn Margulis* popularized the "/endosymbiont theory/".
- "/Endo/" - inside
- "/Symbiont/" - friend
** How it works?

:END:
- a prokaryote ancestor "eats" a smaller prokaryote
- the smaller prokaryote evolves a way to avoid being digested, and lives inside
  its new "/host/" cell kind of like a pet.
- the small prokaryotes that can do _photosynthesis_ evolve into *chloroplasts*, and
  "/pay/" their host with glucose.
- The smaller prokaryotes that can do _aerobic_ respiration evolve into
  *mitochondria*, and convert the _glucose_ into energy the cell can use.
- Both the host and the symbiont benefit from the relationship.
