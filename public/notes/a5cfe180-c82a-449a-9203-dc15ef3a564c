- The magnitude of the resultant vector is given by the _arithmetic difference_ of
  the magnitudes of the individual vectors. The direction follows that of the
  vector with *bigger magnitude*.
*** Given
$\vec{A} = 15\ m,\ North$
$\vec{B} = 28\ m,\ South$
[[file:analytical_method_opposite.png]]
$15\ m/s,\ North + 28\ m/s,\ South \rightarrow \vec{R} = 13\ m\ South$
