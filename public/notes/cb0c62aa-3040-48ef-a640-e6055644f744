- a type of _force_.
- also known as _air drag_ or _aerodynamic drag_, is a force that opposes the motion
  of an object through the air.
- think of it as friction but against *gravity* except it also works horizontally
  but its only for complex problems.
Formula:
$F_{air} = -kv^2$
- $k$ is a /constant/ that depends on the object's shape and other factors.
- $v$ is the object's velocity.
