:END:
1. Draw the _first vector_ with the proper length
    and orientation.
2. Draw the _second vector_ with the proper length
    and orientation originating from the head of
    the first vector.
3. The _resultant vector_ is the vector originating
    at the tail of the first vector and terminating
    at the head of the second vector.
4. Measure the length and orientation angle of
    the resultant.
* Parallelogram Method

:END:
1. Draw both vectors with proper length and
    orientation originating from the same point.
2. Complete a parallelogram using the two
    vectors as two of the sides.
3. Draw the resultant vector as the diagonal
    originating from the tails.
4. Measure the length and angle of the
    resultant vector.
