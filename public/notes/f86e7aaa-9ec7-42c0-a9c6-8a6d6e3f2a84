** Experimental Design
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f86e7aaa-9ec7-42c0-a9c6-8a6d6e3f2a84
:END:
- quantitative research design that bases its research method on an *experiment.
- in which a *test or examination* of a thing under a _manipulated or controlled environment_ is done to determine the validity of a thing.
- involves two groups of subjects:
  + _Experimental group_: in which the condition, treatment, or intervention is applied.
  + _Control group_: not given any treatment.
*** Quasi Experimental

:END:
- also called /Causal comparative/.
- has *cause and effect relationship* of variables.
- _lesser validity_ due to the absence of random selection and assignment of subjects.
- /Gay (1996)/ considers this design as _descriptive_, for it describes existing conditions.
- more *structured manipulation* of _independent variables_.
- often used when [[id:ef6a169e-6c76-4a46-81da-ccdb2bbd2129][true experiments]] are not feasible due to ethical or practical constraints.
- the term /quasi/ means partly, partially, pseudo or almost.

*** True Experimental
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ef6a169e-6c76-4a46-81da-ccdb2bbd2129
:END:
- a more robust design and has _more conclusive result_ than [[id:c2c8798b-98c3-4b77-9510-c1980761d31b][Quasi Experimental]].
- the researcher is authorized to control the situation and manipulates the _independent variable_ to detect its influence on the _dependent variable_.
- /Bryman (2008)/ In social science, many IVs cannot be manipulated.
- it uses random assignment of subjects and experimental manipulation.
