- [[id:a7977a7d-2910-471c-a0c1-58a7f58daa54][Velocity]] is changing at /constant/ rate.
- [[id:bbe2b7b4-6392-441c-b597-f38a51d66d7d][Acceleration]] is /constant/.
- If an object changes its velocity from an _initial velocity_ $v_i$, and a _final
  velocity_ $v_f$, during a time interval $t$, its acceleration is given by:
Formula:
\begin{equation*}
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}
\end{equation*}
