- *Simplest* type of motion.
- [[id:a7977a7d-2910-471c-a0c1-58a7f58daa54][Velocity]] is /constant/.
- [[id:bbe2b7b4-6392-441c-b597-f38a51d66d7d][Acceleration]] is /zero/. $A = 0$
- [[id:d6fc47b7-859d-4aea-982d-2b8d06e7f823][Instantaneous Velocity]] is equal to average velocity. $V_I = V_a$
- Its [[id:6932631c-365d-4d5a-a04c-cb07f308b00d][displacement]] $d_x$ may be obtained by multiplying its constant velocity
  /v/ by the time.
Formula:
$d_x = vt$

- [[id:a7977a7d-2910-471c-a0c1-58a7f58daa54][Velocity]] is changing at /constant/ rate.
- [[id:bbe2b7b4-6392-441c-b597-f38a51d66d7d][Acceleration]] is /constant/.
- If an object changes its velocity from an _initial velocity_ $v_i$, and a _final
  velocity_ $v_f$, during a time interval $t$, its acceleration is given by:
Formula:
\begin{equation*}
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}
\end{equation*}
